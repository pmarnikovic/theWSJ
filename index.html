Slow losses over and over. Found spy options. First day trading them, I went from around $11000 to over $40000, then closed position at around $7500. The next day I tried again, took my $7500 to over $11000, then wound up closing position with around $4000 in account. I really had no idea what I was doing or how the contracts would diminish in value as the day went on. The last few weeks have been a cycle of a few good days, then blow account on a bad trade by not getting out when it went against me. Deposit more money, rinse and repeat. Last Friday I was down to about $700 in my account, threw another $1000 on top of it, and was able to turn that into $4600 on spy, which is where I started on Monday. This week I still did a few spy trades, but switched primarily to spx. And these last 3 days have been incredible. My account has gone from $4600&gt;$9600&gt;$30000&gt;$93000 today.<br /> I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get the usual comments about working at Wendy‚Äôs, put it on roulette, luck in a bull market, etc‚Ä¶.and that‚Äôs cool.

                    <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>US Senator Tom Cotton has put Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan on the hot seat, asking the board to explain how the new CEO's long-running financial ties to Chinese tech firms square with the company's critical position in the US semiconductor supply chain. In a letter to Intel Chair Frank Yeary, released on Wednesday, Cotton cites a probe that found Tan, through his venture firm, Walden International, still holds stakes in more than 600 Chinese companies, including chip startups that supply China's military. The Senator wants written proof that Tan has fully divested from any outfit on the Treasury's blacklist, warning that &quot;Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations. Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations.&quot;</p> <p>While there is no ban on Walden International VC company from investing in Chinese startups, Intel is enjoying a significant boost from US funds. In September, Intel was awarded $3 billion in direct funding from the Biden administration under the CHIPS and Science Act for the Secure Enclave program. Hence, US senators are now questioning whether the new CEO has fully divested from its China commitments, allowing him to focus solely on the US-centric business. Troubles for Intel keep piling up, and the company is currently facing its toughest period, so we have to see how the board and the CEO plan to address these issues.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Astigi"> /u/Astigi </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mjtt4i/intel_ceo_lipbu_tan_questioned_by_us_senator/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mjtt4i/intel_ceo_lipbu_tan_questioned_by_us_senator/">[comments]</a></span></p>

                    <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Stocks initially rallied Thursday after President Donald Trump announced a day earlier that he will impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductor chips, though not for companies that are ‚Äúbuilding in the United States.‚Äù The announcement sent shares of key semiconductor names like Advanced Micro Devices 5.7% higher. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF $SMH popped more than 1%.</p> <p>Apple ticked up about 3% after the iPhone maker announced plans to spend an additional $100 billion on U.S. companies and suppliers over the next four years. That‚Äôs on top of a $500 billion announcement Apple made in February. Some other stocks like INTC, AMD, MAAS, BGM, ASML, and APP might also be influenced by Apple's decision. </p> <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors,‚Äù Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday. ‚ÄúBut the good news for companies like Apple is if you‚Äôre building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge.‚Äù</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zestyclose-Salad-290"> /u/Zestyclose-Salad-290 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mki64m/looking_past_tariffs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mki64m/looking_past_tariffs/">[comments]</a></span></p>
