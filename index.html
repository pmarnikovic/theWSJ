The next day I tried again, took my $7500 to over $11000, then wound up closing position with around $4000 in account. I really had no idea what I was doing or how the contracts would diminish in value as the day went on. The last few weeks have been a cycle of a few good days, then blow account on a bad trade by not getting out when it went against me. Deposit more money, rinse and repeat. Last Friday I was down to about $700 in my account, threw another $1000 on top of it, and was able to turn that into $4600 on spy, which is where I started on Monday. This week I still did a few spy trades, but switched primarily to spx. And these last 3 days have been incredible. My account has gone from $4600&gt;$9600&gt;$30000&gt;$93000 today.<br /> I’m sure I’ll get the usual comments about working at Wendy’s, put it on roulette, luck in a bull market, etc….and that’s cool. Just excited to share this incredible journey</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Better_Mongoose_1722"> /u/Better_Mongoose_1722 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mjhm1f">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mjhm1f/made_back_all_my_yearly_losses_in_3_days/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></p>

                    <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ladies and Gentlemen, we all know about the rise Meta stock had since 2022 when it was trading at a PE of 9. I bring you the META of 2025, Sarepta Pharmaceuticals $SRPT which is currently trading at a PE of 2. The stock was trading at $150 last year and is currently trading at at $17.3. The reason two patient deaths in non- ambulatory patients earlier this year. The company has since stopped shipping shipments for non-ambulatory patients.</p> <p>Revenue Breakdown: The company had $2.2 billion in revenue last year based on 4 approved drugs on the market. 1 billion came from 3 drugs combined. Another billion came from the 4th drug named Elevidys. From the $1.2 billion share, 80% revenue comes from ambulatory patients. Hence, even if the shipments to non-ambulatory population is halted, the company can still make around 1 billion revenue from the ambulatory population. More than 800 ambulatory patients have been dosed in past 2 years and there have been 0 deaths.

                    <h3>McDonald’s sees U.S. sales rebound, but concerns about low-income consumers linger</h3>
                    <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>McDonald’s on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations as buzzy promotions helped its U.S. restaurants rebound.</p> <p>Despite the chain’s improved performance this quarter, executives are still worried about the economic health of the low-income consumer. McDonald’s is working with its U.S. franchisees on ways to make its core menu items more affordable, beyond the $5 meal deal it rolled out last summer and the newer Daily Double burger promotion.</p> <p>“Reengaging the low-income consumer is critical, as they typically visit our restaurants more frequently than middle- and high-income consumers,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts on the company’s earnings conference call. “This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the U.S. consumer.”</p> <p>Executives said they anticipate that McDonald’s results will be stronger in the second half of the year, particularly as the chain faces easier comparisons in the fourth quarter to the fallout from last year’s E. coil outbreak.</p> <p>Shares of the company rose more than 2% in morning trading.</p> <p>Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Earnings per share:</strong> $3.19 adjusted vs. $3.15 expected</li> <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $6.84 billion vs. $6.7 billion expected</li> </ul> <p>The fast-food giant reported second-quarter net income of $2.25 billion, or $3.14 per share, up from $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier.</p> <p>Excluding restructuring charges and other items, McDonald’s earned $3.19 per share.</p> <p>Revenue rose 5% to $6.84 billion. Kempczinski credited the chain’s value, marketing and new menu items for the 6% increase in system sales during the quarter.</p> <p>Same-store sales, a metric that only tracks the performance of restaurants that have been open at least a year, increased 3.8%, the chain’s biggest jump in nearly two years.</p> <p>McDonald’s U.S. restaurants saw same-store sales growth of 2.5%, reversing two straight quarters of domestic declines. Kempczinski said the burger chain outperformed its rivals by both same-store sales and comparable traffic.</p> <p>“Certainly, overall [quick-service restaurant] traffic in the U.S. remained challenging, as visits across the industry by low-income consumers once again declined by double digits versus the prior year period,” he said.</p> <p>This quarter, the burger chain’s U.S. sales received a boost from a tie-in meal with the “Minecraft” movie and the launch of the McCrispy Chicken Strips.</p> <p>Shortly after the quarter ended, Snack Wraps returned to menus for the first time in nine years; executives said that early results are “encouraging,” and franchisees have voted to maintain the $2.99 promotional price through the end of the year.</p> <p>Outside the U.S., demand for its Big Macs and french fries was even stronger.</p> <p>“I would just note, also on our international side, it’s not as competitive a market as it is in the U.S.,” Kempczinski said. “I think it’s a little bit easier for us to stand out and represent good value in international.”</p> <p>The chain’s international developmental licensed markets division, which includes Japan and China, reported same-store sales growth of 5.6%.</p> <p>Its international operated markets segment saw same-store sales growth of 4%, thanks to gains in markets like the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. Executives said McDonald’s value and affordability scores from consumers have improved in key markets.</p> <p>Source: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/mcdonalds-mcd-q2-2025-earnings.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/mcdonalds-mcd-q2-2025-earnings.html</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Puginator"> /u/Puginator </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mj56fq/mcdonalds_sees_us_sales_rebound_but_concerns/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mj56fq/mcdonalds_sees_us_sales_rebound_but_concerns/">[comments]</a></span></p>

And most folks on this sub have repeatedly mentioned that it is a 400B market cap company with revenue of just 1B, and pe ratio is 675 and hence, we should stay out of it. However, some folks on this sub have mentioned that you should not look at pe ratio of companies like pltr. One other person who says that is Keith Fitzgerald.

Or is these something that is known but is not mentioned enough number of times on this sub as to why it makes sense to buy this stock when the pe ratio is so high?

                    <h3>Novo Nordisk Reports 16% Sales Increase, 25% Rise in Operating Profit for H1 2025; Lowers Full-Year Sales Outlook</h3>
                    <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Novo Nordisk A/S has reported a 16% increase in sales measured in Danish kroner and an 18% rise at constant exchange rates (CER), reaching DKK 154.9 billion for the first half of 2025. The company's operating profit has also seen a significant increase of 25% in Danish kroner and 29% at CER, amounting to DKK 72.2 billion. In the US, sales grew by 16% in Danish kroner (17% at CER), notably influenced by adjustments related to prior years, including a DKK 3 billion adjustment for the 340B provision in the second quarter. International operations experienced a sales increase of 16% in Danish kroner and 19% at CER. Despite these strong first-half results, Novo Nordisk has revised its full-year outlook downwards. The company now anticipates sales growth of 8-14% at CER and operating profit growth of 10-16% at CER for 2025. In Danish kroner, this growth is expected to be 3 and 5 percentage points lower, respectively. The adjustment in the outlook is attributed to lower growth expectations for the second half of 2025, driven by factors such as persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion, and competition. Specifically, there are lowered growth expectations for Wegovy® in the US obesity market and for Ozempic® in the US GLP-1 diabetes market, as well as for Wegovy® in select international markets. Novo Nordisk continues to focus on expanding the global presence of Wegovy® and is investing in commercial activities to enhance market penetration for both Wegovy® and Ozempic®.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/samy_samyeer"> /u/samy_samyeer </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1miwlxo/novo_nordisk_reports_16_sales_increase_25_rise_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1miwlxo/novo_nordisk_reports_16_sales_increase_25_rise_in/">[comments]</a></span></p>

                    <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Disney reported results for its fiscal third quarter on Wednesday – posting earnings that topped expectations but revenue that came in just shy of analyst projections – as the company’s streaming business grew and its theme parks saw higher spending from consumers. </p> <p>CFO Hugh Johnston credited the quarter in part to the success of Disney’s streaming unit, anchored by its flagship service, Disney+.</p> <p>“Just as a reminder, it was only a couple of years ago that we were losing a billion dollars a quarter on that business,” Johnston told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday. “It was trading purely on subs and not on financial results. We now really have a solid foundation.”</p> <p>The growth in streaming has recently started to help to supplant the losses of the cash cow traditional TV business, which has been bleeding customers for years now.</p> <p>Disney shares were down 2% in premarketing trading Wednesday.</p> <p>Here is what Disney reported for the quarter ended June 28 compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Earnings per share:</strong> $1.61 adjusted vs. $1.47 expected</li> <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $23.65 billion vs. $23.73 billion expected</li> </ul> <p>Net income for the quarter was $5.26 billion, or $2.92 per share, more than double the $2.62 billion, or $1.43 a share, that the company reported for the same period last year. Adjusting for one-time items, primarily related to tax benefits associated with Disney’s purchase of Comcast’s Hulu stake, Disney reported earnings per share of $1.61. </p> <p>Disney’s overall revenue rose 2% to $23.65 billion, missing analyst expectations for the first time since May 2024. </p> <p>The company reported continued growth in its streaming business despite headwinds in the traditional TV bundle, which has suffered from declining customers. </p> <p>Disney upped its fiscal 2025 guidance on Wednesday and now expects adjusted EPS of $5.85 – an increase of 18% from fiscal 2024. In May, Disney issued guidance for expected full-year adjusted EPS of $5.75.</p> <p>Source: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/disney-dis-earnings-q3-2025.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/disney-dis-earnings-q3-2025.html</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Puginator"> /u/Puginator </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mj558f/disney_earnings_top_expectations_as_streaming/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mj558f/disney_earnings_top_expectations_as_streaming/">[comments]</a></span></p>

Previously, it was limited to imported AVs.</p> <p>The easing of regulations will benefit Zoox and its competitors.</p> <p>Tesla has announced that it plans to produce a two-seater CyberCab with no steering wheel or pedals down the line.</p> <p>The expansion of the Automated Vehicle Exemption Program could make it easier for the company to conduct testing and operate on public, U.S. roadways if Elon Musk’s automaker can meet the agency’s requirements.</p> <p>Zoox, founded 11 years ago and purchased by Amazon for $1.3 billion in 2020, has been gearing up for further expansion this year.</p> <p>The company in June opened a robotaxi manufacturing facility in the San Francisco Bay Area, where it aims to eventually produce 10,000 vehicles a year once it’s at full scale.</p> <p>Zoox needs more of its toaster-shaped robotaxis to roll off the assembly line to fulfill its mission of deploying a commercial ride-hailing service in the U.S.</p> <p>The company has eyed Las Vegas as its first commercial market, and said it plans to begin service there later this year.</p> <p>Source: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/amazon-zoox-robotaxi.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/amazon-zoox-robotaxi.html</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Puginator"> /u/Puginator </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mjf3jm/amazons_zoox_robotaxi_unit_clears_regulatory/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mjf3jm/amazons_zoox_robotaxi_unit_clears_regulatory/">[comments]</a></span></p>

                    <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Snap shares tanked 15% Tuesday when it reported second-quarter earnings in which global average revenue per user missed expectations.</p> <p>Here is how the company did compared with Wall Street’s expectations:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Earnings per share:</strong> Loss of 16 cents. That figure is not comparable to analysts’ estimates.</li> <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $1.34 billion vs. $1.35 billion expected, according to LSEG </li> <li><strong>Global daily active users:</strong> 469 million vs. 467 million expected, according to StreetAccount</li> <li><strong>Global average revenue per user:</strong> $2.87 vs. $2.90 expected, according to StreetAccount</li> </ul> <p>Snap said its second-quarter sales grew 9% year over year while it recorded a net loss of $262.6 million. The company’s net loss during the same quarter last year was $248.6 million.</p> <p>Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the second quarter came in at $41 million, trailing the $53 million that StreetAccount was projecting.</p> <p>Snap said third-quarter revenue will come in between $1.475 billion and $1.505 billion, ahead of Wall Street estimates of $1.475 billion.</p> <p>The company said adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter will be in the range between $110 million and $135 million. That figure’s midpoint of $122.5 million is higher than StreetAccount’s projections of $116 million.</p> <p>Snap said third-quarter global daily active users will total 476 million, roughly in line with the 475.7 million StreetAccount is expecting.</p> <p>The company’s Snapchat+ subscription service is approaching 16 million in the second quarter, representing a 42% year-over-year increase, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel wrote in an investor letter. Snap’s subscription service is the “largest driver” to the company’s Other Revenue category, rising 64% year over year to $171 million in the second quarter, Spiegel said.</p> <p>Snap’s adjusted operating expenses for the second quarter rose 10% year over year to $654 million, Spiegel said in the letter.</p> <p>Spiegel said in an investor letter that it will be “distributing” its engineering teams to “directly support” its business functions, resulting in its core applications team reporting to tech chief Bobby Murphy. The monetization engineering team will be reporting to business chief Ajit Mohan.</p> <p>“Our Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer will report to me and lead enterprise-wide foundational infrastructure and platform integrity,” Spiegel said in the letter. “This new, distributed structure will empower our teams to take greater ownership and drive continued innovation for our community and advertising partners.”</p> <p>Source: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/snap-q2-earnings-report-2025.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/snap-q2-earnings-report-2025.html</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Puginator"> /u/Puginator </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mikakj/snap_shares_plummet_15_after_weak_second_quarter/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mikakj/snap_shares_plummet_15_after_weak_second_quarter/">[comments]</a></span></p>

                    <h3>Rebalancing porfolio</h3>
                    <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking at my portfolio this morning and noticed my stocks are now 45% of my total. Used to be ETFs 85% and stocks 15%, but NVDA, PLTR, META, NFLX, MSFT and a few others went and messed it all up. Several finance forums and books mention rebalancing investments regularly, but I mean do people actually sell super strong stocks to convert to ETFs? I mean wouldn't that be a bad move from a return perspective? But I guess the goal is to secure the profits and remove risky positions.</p> <p>Curious to know what other people do in this situation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Drama8139"> /u/Ok_Drama8139 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mjbkv0/rebalancing_porfolio/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mjbkv0/rebalancing_porfolio/">[comments]</a></span></p>

                    <h3>New semiconductor tariff plan coming as soon as next week</h3>
                    <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/trump-tariffs-chips-semiconductors.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/trump-tariffs-chips-semiconductors.html</a></p> <blockquote> <p>President Donald Trump said Tuesday he will unveil new tariffs on semiconductors and chips as soon as next week.</p> <p>“We’re going to be announcing on semiconductors and chips, which is a separate category, because we want them made in the United States,” Trump said during a lengthy interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”</p> <p>Trump said that that announcement will come “within the next week or so.”</p> <p>Global demand for semiconductors and microchips has skyrocketed as the technology has become integrated in virtually all sectors of the economy, including the booming artificial intelligence industry.</p> <p>Trump revealed the tariff timeline days after he signed an executive order to impose new U.S. duties on a slew of countries’ imports, with some trading partners facing steep hikes.</p> <p>But his remarks on CNBC on Tuesday morning emphasized that his tariff plans are far from finished.</p> <p>Trump said in the same appearance that tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could eventually reach up to 250%. He had previously said that those tariffs would top out at 200%.</p> <p>“I have the best poll numbers I’ve ever had” because “people love the tariffs,” Trump claimed in the interview - even though his approval rating has dipped in multiple poll trackers’ latest updates. </p> </blockquote> <p>In this why $INTC is up 3% this morning already?</p> <p>Also what sort of impact will this have on TSMC? I feel like most chip designers utilizing them don't really have many good alternatives so they will be forced to pay the higher prices</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fidler_2K"> /u/Fidler_2K </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mi9ioj/new_semiconductor_tariff_plan_coming_as_soon_as/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mi9ioj/new_semiconductor_tariff_plan_coming_as_soon_as/">[comments]</a></span></p>

                    <h3>S&P 500 may get a new member soon! Which company do you think would make it into the index?</h3>
                    <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Paramount Global (PARA) could be on the chopping block if the S&amp;P 500’s managers decide its impending merger with Skydance Media makes it too small for the benchmark large-cap index. Paramount’s current market capitalization of about $8 billion is one of the lowest in the index, and well below the $22 billion S&amp;P Global requires of new entrants.</p> <p>S&amp;P considers a company’s float-adjusted market cap and liquidity when determining eligibility, and the Skydance merger could impact both for Paramount. The merger is set to close on Thursday (August 7, 2025), after which the new company will trade under the symbol “PSKY”.</p> <p>But there won’t be much “PSKY” to trade; per the terms of the agreement, Skydance will own roughly 70% of Paramount’s outstanding shares. That could shrink its float-adjusted value to about $3 billion, an amount S&amp;P Global might consider inappropriate for the index, or too small to ensure adequate liquidity.</p> <p>Paramount’s merger could be the opportunity investors in Applovin (APP) and Robinhood (HOOD) hoped would come earlier this year. Both were considered top candidates to replace Hess (HESS) in the index when it was acquired by Chevron (CVX) earlier this month. The retail investor favorites easily satisfy S&amp;P’s market cap and profit eligibility criteria, but were passed over in favor of fintech Block (XYZ).</p> <p>Other top contenders for inclusion would be Interactive Brokers (IBKR), EMCOR (EME), and Comfort Systems USA (FIX), the three largest components of the mid-cap S&amp;P 400.</p> <p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/why-the-s-and-p-500-may-get-a-new-member-soon-11782865">https://www.investopedia.com/why-the-s-and-p-500-may-get-a-new-member-soon-11782865</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Choobeen"> /u/Choobeen </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mjm4qu/sp_500_may_get_a_new_member_soon_which_company_do/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mjm4qu/sp_500_may_get_a_new_member_soon_which_company_do/">[comments]</a></span></p>

                    <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am 23 years old with a roth ira i opened last october and maxed out. I have done nothing inside of the roth aside from auto invest $30/day into VOO. I have accumulated about 12 shares total and am up 12% inside of the account. With recent market uncertanty I've been thinking about selling my shares, realizing profit, and then beginning to wheel instead of accumulating more VOO shares. I would only be wheeling with ~$7800 for the time being but plan on maxing my roth out again this year. Is this a bad idea? Would anyone advise against? What are the potential downfalls i should look out for? I understand I wouldnt be able to wheel any stock with a higher price than $78 absolute max for the time being but after doing a considerable amount of research and risk assessment this seems like a reasonable plan to me...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bgb999_"> /u/bgb999_ </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mjlmbw/looking_to_start_wheelingpost_got_removed_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mjlmbw/looking_to_start_wheelingpost_got_removed_in/">[comments]</a></span></p>
